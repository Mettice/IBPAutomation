# Intelligent Business Process Automation (IBPA) System

## Overview

The Intelligent Business Process Automation (IBPA) system is a multi-agent AI solution designed to analyze, optimize, and automate business processes. Leveraging the power of CrewAI, this system employs specialized AI agents to perform data analysis, process optimization, and automation implementation.

## Features

1. **Data Analysis**
   - Utilizes a Data Analyst agent to identify trends and inefficiencies in company data
   - Processes historical sales, expenses, and customer satisfaction data
   - Generates insights on top inefficiencies in business processes

2. **Process Optimization**
   - Employs a Process Optimizer agent to develop improvement strategies
   - Creates actionable plans to address identified inefficiencies
   - Leverages Lean Six Sigma methodologies for optimization

3. **Automation Implementation**
   - Features an Automation Engineer agent to design and implement automated solutions
   - Focuses on the top priority improvements identified by the Process Optimizer
   - Aims to streamline operations and reduce manual intervention

4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Utilizes CrewAI to orchestrate collaboration between specialized AI agents
   - Implements a sequential workflow for cohesive analysis, optimization, and automation

5. **Mock Data Generation**
   - Includes utilities to generate realistic mock data for testing and demonstration
   - Simulates a year's worth of daily business data including sales, expenses, and customer satisfaction scores

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd ibpa_project
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```
   python -m venv ibpa_env
   ibpa_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source ibpa_env/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the IBPA system:

```
python main.py
```

This will initiate the following process:
1. Generate mock business data
2. Analyze the data for inefficiencies
3. Develop process improvement strategies
4. Create automation scripts for priority improvements

## Customization

- Modify `src/utils/data_utils.py` to change mock data generation or integrate with real data sources
- Adjust agent parameters in `src/agents/agents.py` to fine-tune agent behaviors
- Customize tasks in `src/tasks/tasks.py` to alter the specific jobs assigned to each agent

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time data sources
- Implementation of more sophisticated AI models for each agent
- Addition of a user interface for easier interaction and visualization
- Expansion of the agent crew to cover more specialized business functions
